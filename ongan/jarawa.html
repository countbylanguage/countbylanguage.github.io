  <h1>Jarawa</h1>
  <p><i>Ongan > Jarawa</i></p>
  <p>Jarawa is an Ongan language spoken in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands by about 250 people. It is an endangered language, and it isn't traditionally written, although occasionally uses the Devanagari script. It has numerals for numbers from 1 to 3, but has added 4 and 5 recently, and they use Hindi numerals to count to outsiders.</p>
  <p>Here are the numbers from one to five, as well as the word for "many", translated to Jarawa:</p>
